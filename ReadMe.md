Just another workbook, this one is about web scraping in Python. I need it to mine data for our own databases with concern to the international relations.

I use a book Mitchell R. "Web Scraping with Python", O'Reilly Media, Inc. (2018) as a base but the workbook in order to have real practical value must contain information from different sources, especially from the libraries official documentation. All the example code is tested on my Debian Bookworm system, I use virtual environment based on Python3.12 and all the newest releases of its libraries. It may seem strange, but I actively consult with the ChatGPT 3.5, this is my first assistant in the lack of anybody alive who I could talk to on the programming problems. I explicitly mark the text from ChatGPT when I use info from it.

I used to create workbooks in the JupyterNB format which I consider very convenient and flexible. I have all the needed kernels installed. There is one (not a really) problem though - I did not figure out how to make the Bash Jupyter kernel work in the given virtual environment, so I just go to the Bash terminal, activate the venv and execute commands there. Python venv kernel works perfectly, all the code can be executed straightly inside the JupyterNB. That's it.
