    "- descendants can be at any level in the tree below a parent. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `tr` tags are children of the `table` tag, whereas `tr`, `th`, `td`, `img`, and `span` are all descendants of the `table` tag (at least in our example page). All children are descendants, but not all descendants are children.\n",

    "In general, BeautifulSoup functions always deal with the descendants of the current tag selected. For instance, `bs.body.h1` selects the first `h1` tag that is a descendant of the `body` tag. It will not find tags located outside the `body`.\n",

    "As the old computer science joke goes: “_Let’s say you have a problem, and you decide to solve it with regular expressions. Well, now you have two problems_.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, **regular expressions** (often shortened to **regex**) are often taught using large tables of random symbols, strung together to look like a lot of nonsense. This tends to drive people away, and later they get out into the workforce and write needlessly complicated searching and filtering functions, when all they needed was a one-line regular expression in the first place!\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are so called because they are used to identify **regular strings**; they can definitively say, “_Yes, this string you’ve given me follows the rules, and I’ll return it_,” or “_This string does not follow the rules, and I’ll discard it_.” This can be exceptionally handy for quickly scanning large documents to look for strings that look like phone numbers or email addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a regular string? It’s any string that can be generated by a series of **linear rules** such as these:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write the letter `a` at least once.\n",
    "- Append to this the letter `b` exactly five times.\n",
    "- Append to this the letter `c` any even number of times.\n",
    "- Write either the letter `d` or `e` at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings that follow these rules are `aaaabbbbbccccd`, `aabbbbbcce`, and so on (there are an infinite number of variations).\n",
    "\n",
    "> You might be asking yourself, “_Are there ‘irregular’ expressions_?” **Nonregular expressions** are beyond the scope of this book, but they encompass strings such as “write a prime number of as, followed by exactly twice that number of bs” or “write a palindrome.” It’s impossible to identify strings of this type with a regular expression. \n",

    "Regular expressions are merely a shorthand way of expressing these sets of rules. For instance, here’s the regular expression for the series of steps just described:\n",

    "- `(d|e)` - Adding a bar in the middle of two expressions means that it can be “_this thing or that thing_.” In this case, you are saying “_add a d or an e_.” In this way, you can guarantee that there is exactly one of either of these two characters."
